## ðŸš€ Usage

Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed. Open Terminal in the project folder and run:
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```
Running this for the first time may take some time to download all dependencies. 
When it's ready you will see a "Jupyter Server is running" message in the terminal.

Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab/workspaces/auto-7/tree/volume](http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab/workspaces/auto-7/tree/volume)

Create a folder named scanData in the project folder. You can put scan files in it.

Enjoy!
